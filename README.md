# MegaDash

This is the dashboard I use for iRacing.

Requirements:  You'll need the [DahlDesign](https://github.com/andreasdahl1987/DahlDesignProperties) SimHub Plugin

FAQ:  Isn't this just Lovely Dashboard?

No.  While I certainly took some design ideas from that work (and with permission), all the screens, layouts, code and datasources are not shared
